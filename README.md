<h2 align="center">About 📖</h2>

<p align="center">
   A simple and awesome Udemy Clone made with Flutter, using sensational Responsiveness Techniques.<br>
   A clone made for study and learning, and I'm sure I acquired too much in this project.<br>
   If you want to learn how to do a similar one, access the course: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/responsividade-flutter/" target="_blank">Responsiveness in the Flutter | Mobile, Tablet, Web e Desktop</a>, of which I am a teaching instructor! I hope you enjoy!

<h2 align="center">Challenges and Learnings along the way 🤯</h2>

<p>
   This was my first experience generating such an application with Flutter, with Total Responsiveness, adapting to all types of screens possible, using the super amazing DevicePreview package, among others experiencies that I contained, it was sensational!<br>
   Another challenge I had was to host, and I decided to do this with <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/" target="_blank">Firebase Hosting</a>, which is very simple and practical to do. But for me, I had some extra problems, which took me hours and hours to understand, solve, and reach a final conclusion. In the end, luckily and as expected, everything went well!<br>
   It's a simple and basic, but I learned a lot about Responsiveness!!! 📱💻🖥
